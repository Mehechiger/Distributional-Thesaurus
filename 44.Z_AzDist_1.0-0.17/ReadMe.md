**What is AzDist?**
AzDist is a distributionnal thesaurus realized as part of the L3LI projet in Universit√© Paris-Diderot. It reads CoNLL format corpora and genrates automatically a thesaurus according to the distribution of words in various contexts.

**Prerequisites**
Hardware: AzDist is designed to be functionnal under any modern computer with a minimum of live memories of 4GB (for CoNLL format corpora of around 5GB). Note that for certain features such as 3 and above grams mode, more live memories are required.
Software dependencies: AzDist requires a certain number of python libraries installed, in particular: tqdm, SciPy, NumPy, NumExpr, Pandas.

**Installation**
Just decompress the archive in a folder.

**Quick start**
Go into the program folder under the command line tool, and simply run it with:
`python3 AzDist.py --d *DIRECTORY_OF_CONLL_CORPORA*`
Detailed progress is given on screen. After a few minutes (depending on your computer's hardwares), the program will notify you of it's completion. Some csv files such as "AzDist_A.csv" should appear in the program folder, where "A" indicates the "adjective" part of speech, which would be your fresh baked distributionnal thesaurus (by part of speech).

**Advanced parameters**
Advanced parameters could be passed to AzDist under command line while launching:

| `-m {['2', 'gram'],['3', 'gram'],['4', 'gram'],['5', 'gram'],['6', 'gram'],['7', 'gram'],['8', 'gram'],['9', 'gram'],dep}`<br />`--mode {['2', 'gram'],['3', 'gram'],['4', 'gram'],['5', 'gram'],['6', 'gram'],['7', 'gram'],['8', 'gram'],['9', 'gram'],dep}` | contexts extract mode(specify the n in case of ngram, use dash - to seperate n and gram and do not insert space between them, eg. "python3 AzDist -m 5-gram"); default is 2-gram |
| `-wf {RelFreq,TTest,PMI}`<br />`--wfunc {RelFreq,TTest,PMI}` | weight function; default is TTest                            |

| `-s SIZE`<br />`--size SIZE`                                 | number of similar words under one item; default is 10        |
| `-p PATH`<br />`--path PATH`                                 | set output (abs) path; default is path of AzDist.py          |
